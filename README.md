This project is about a gym system that uses qrcode to identify clients. You can add new clients using the control tab and entering the username and password,
then add the desired information: His/her name, email and the months. After you add a new client, it will send the qrcode picture to his/her email.
You MUST, before that, configure your GMAIL address and the password (use gmail app password for better security).

You can configure the offers and the clients that you registered. Also, you can resend the qrcode using the button in the "Clients Control Tab"
incase the client lost their qrcode picture.

Finally, the client can scan their qrcode using the webcam attached to the system. All their information will be displayed.
